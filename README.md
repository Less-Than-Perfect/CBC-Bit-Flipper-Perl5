# CBC-Bit-Flipper-Perl5
# Failed
I told myself I would upload this on the 25th... so I did. I'm not sure why it doesn't work; I thinking it could just be what I'm testing it against.

# To-do
- [ x ] Create something that looks like it maybe could work
- [ ] Create a local sever (python? php?) for testing
- [ ] Comfirm basic function
- [ ] Finalize Loops
- [ ] Add user friendliness
- [ ] Think of features to be added
- [ ] Create Documentation
