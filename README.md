# CBC-Bit-Flipper-Perl5
# Failed
I told myself I would upload this on the 25th... so I did. I'm not sure why it doesn't work; I thinking it could just be what I'm testing it against. ~I hope to have something function by the end of the month.~ I got stuck for a little while, so lets aim for the end of this week (the 7th). I'm hoping I just have some logistics incorrect; rather, than a fundamentals problem.

# To-do
- [x] Create something that looks like it maybe could work
- [x] Create a local sever (python? php?) for testing
- [ ] Comfirm basic function
- [ ] Finalize Loops
- [ ] Add user friendliness
- [ ] Think of features to be added
- [ ] Create Documentation

# Why Perl?
Why not? This is in fact my first Perl script, horrible right?
